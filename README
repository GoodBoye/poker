PET - Poker Equity Tool

PET is written in Java 1.6 using Swing, and will run on any major OS 
with Java installed.

It includes

- A poker equity calculator for 
  - hold'em, omaha, omaha hi/lo - estimated pre-flop, and exact post 
    flop
  - 5 card draw, always estimated

- A fast (2MB/s) PokerStars hand parser, with
   - searchable/sortable lists of players, games, tournaments and hands
   - Two hand replayers, both including hand equity and SPR (stack to 
     pot ratio)
   - a floating HUD for tables currently being played at, with 
     statistics like
     - VPIP (voluntarily put in pot)
     - AF (aggression factor)
     - PFR (preflop/first street raises)
     - FS (flops seen), SS (showdowns seen), SW (showdowns won)

PET does not modify, move or copy parsed hand history files, or share 
them with others (as doing so would be against the PokerStars TOS).

Limitations
- The parser is too strict
- History files can't be filtered before parsing
- Some of the stats may be wrong
- Omaha hi/lo equity calculations are a bit complicated
- The GUI layout is rough in places, and no keyboard controls
- Various other bugs from lack of testing
